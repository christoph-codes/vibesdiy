			<p>
				Tufting is an activity using a tufting gun that loops yarn into
				fabric to create your own personal art rug. Tufting is typically
				done in these steps as followed: tracing, tufting, gluing,
				trimming and applying the backing.

		title: 'Is tufting difficult?',
		content: (
			<p>
				It’s not as intimidating as it looks. We will have a practice
				frame for YOU to test the basic movements and techniques before
				you start your session. We’ll be there to guide you along the
				way, but what’s most important is to relax, and get lost in your
				art while HAVING FUN!

				Every class includes time for you to cut and trim your rug. You

				additional cost. This does require you to come back and pick up
				your rug at a later day. Please reference our pricing menu.
